1. Create a separate database for the ClickHouse peer called peerdb. This is where tables will be auto created and synced by PeerDB.
```sql
   CREATE DATABASE peerdb;
```
2. Make sure you have a database user who has permissions for DDL, DML and SELECT operations on ClickHouse.
3. Create the ClickHouse Peer through UI
    <Frame caption="Choose PostgreSQL Peer">
    <img src="/images/setup/clickhouse/create_mirror.png" />
    </Frame>
    1. Enter all the details `Name`, `Host`, `Port`, `User`, `Password` and `Database`
    2. ClickHouse peer requires AWS S3 for transient staging of data.
    <Warning>
    If you are using **PeerDB Cloud**, you don't need to enter any of these credentials. We take care of transient staging for you.
    </Warning>
    If you are using PeerDB OSS please enter `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_REGION` and `S3 Bucket` while creating the peer.  Note that the `S3 Bucket` should already exist while creating the peer.
