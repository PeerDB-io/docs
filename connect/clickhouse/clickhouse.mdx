This is a document on setting a Clickhouse peer for PeerDB. PeerDB supports ClickHouse as a target for data replication.
### Steps on setting up the ClickHouse peer

1. Create a separate database for the ClickHouse peer called peerdb. This is where tables will be auto-created and synced by PeerDB.
```sql
   CREATE DATABASE peerdb;
```
2. Create a Clickhouse user for PeerDB with the following permissions:
```sql
-- We recommend creating a separate user for PeerDB
CREATE USER peerdb_user IDENTIFIED BY '<password>';

-- PeerDB needs to create tables and insert data into the tables.
-- Drop table permission is needed for DROP MIRROR support
GRANT INSERT, SELECT, DROP, CREATE TABLE ON peerdb.* to peerdb_user;

-- PeerDB uses an intermediary S3 stage for performance
GRANT CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE, s3 on *.* to peerdb_user;

-- For automatic column-addition on the tables in the mirror
GRANT ALTER ADD COLUMN ON peerdb.* to peerdb_user;
```

<Note>
If you need to whitelist PeerDB IPs in Clickhouse Cloud, you can find the IPs of your PeerDB instance [here](/peerdb-cloud/ip-table).
</Note>
3. ClickHouse has several ports exposed, and PeerDB requires to use a port that exposes the `ClickHouse native protocol` which by default is `9440` for the secure TLS-enabled port and `9000` for the non-TLS port. If the default ports have been changed, please adjust them accordingly.
<Warning>
We do not recommend using the non-TLS enabled port for ClickHouse. If this is needed, please also check the `Disable TLS?` option.
</Warning>
4. If you are using PeerDB OSS, we use [MinIO](https://min.io/) as the internal transient stage. You might need to adjust your firewall rules to allow connections from ClickHouse to MinIO. In [PeerDB Cloud](https://app.peerdb.cloud/), we abstract all of this from you. If you run into issues, please reach out to support@peerdb.io or join our Slack [channel](https://slack.peerdb.io).
5. Create the ClickHouse Peer through PeerDB UI

    Enter all the details `Name`, `Host`, `Port` (as determined above), `User`, `Password` and `Database`.
6. Click on `Validate` to ensure that the connection is successful.
7. Click on `Create` to create the ClickHouse Peer.

### Troubleshooting
Here is a list of some validation errors that you might encounter and how to resolve them:

**You may need to disable TLS**

    You may need to disable TLS. Validation errors such as the following may occur if the connection is not successful:
    ```
     failed to ping to Clickhouse peer: tls:
     first record does not look like a TLS handshake
    ```

**EOF**

If you see the following error, it means that the connection to the ClickHouse peer could not be established:
```
failed to open connection to Clickhouse peer:
failed to ping to Clickhouse peer: EOF
```
Please try the following:
1. Ensure that the PeerDB IP is whitelisted in the ClickHouse server. If you are using PeerDB Cloud, you can find the IPs of your PeerDB instance [here](/peerdb-cloud/ip-table).
2. You may need to enable TLS.

**Stuck on Validating...**

This means the port entered is incorrect. Please ensure that the port is correct and the ClickHouse server is reachable from the PeerDB server.
