This is a guide on how to create a supabase PostgreSQL peer which you can use for replication in PeerDB.

PeerDB Cloud supports Supabase via IPv6 natively for seemless replication.

<Steps titleSize='h2'>
<Step title='Creating a user with permissions and replication slot'>

Let's create a new user for PeerDB with the necessary permissions suitable for CDC,
and also create a publication that we'll use for replication. For this, you can head over to the **SQL Editor** for your Supabase Project.

1. Create a Postgres user for exclusively PeerDB.

    1. ```sql
              CREATE USER peerdb_user PASSWORD 'some-password';
        ```

2. Provide read-only access to the schema from which you are replicating tables to the `peerdb_user`. Below example shows setting up permissions for the `public` schema. If you want to grant access to multiple schemas, you can run these three commands for each schema.

    1. ```sql
              GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "public" TO peerdb_user;
              GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "public" TO peerdb_user;
              ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "public" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO peerdb_user;
        ```

3. Grant replication access to this user:

    1. ```sql
           ALTER ROLE peerdb_user REPLICATION;
        ```

4. Create a [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) with the tables you want to replicate. We strongly recommend only including the tables you need in the publication to avoid performance overhead.

    1. To create a publication for specific tables:

      ```sql
      CREATE PUBLICATION peerdb_publication FOR TABLE table_to_replicate, table_to_replicate2;
      ```

   2. To create a publication for all tables in a specific schema:

      ```sql
      CREATE PUBLICATION peerdb_publication FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA "public";
      ```

   The `peerdb_publication` publication will contain the set of change events generated from the specified tables, and will later be used to create the MIRROR (replication).

Click on **Run** to have a publication and a user ready.

<Note>
Make sure to replace `peerdb_user` and `peerdb_password` with your desired username and password.

Also, remember to use the same publication name when creating the mirror in PeerDB.

<Step title='Create the Supabase Peer on PeerDB Cloud'>
<Note>
Make sure you are signed in to your [Supabase console](https://supabase.com/) for this step.
</Note>

Creating the Supabase Peer in PeerDB Cloud is as simple as granting PeerDB access to your Supabase Project.

1. Head over to the PeerDB UI and click on **Create Peer**. Select **Supabase** as the source.

</Frame>

2. You should be redirected to Supabase to authorize PeerDB to access your Supabase Project.
Make sure to select the correct organization from the dropdown and click on **Authorize PeerDB**.

3. You should now see a list of your Supabase Projects. Click on the project you want to create the peer for.

</Frame>


4. Once you select the project, you should see a screen like below with connection details filled in automatically.
Fill in the username and password you created earlier in the SQL Editor in Step 1.

5. Click on **Validate** and once that's green, you can go ahead and click on **Create** to create the peer!

</Step>
<Step title='Increase max_slot_wal_keep_size'>
This is a recommended configuration change to ensure that large transactions/commits do not cause the replication slot to be dropped.

<Warning>
This step will restart your Supabase database and may cause a brief downtime.
</Warning>

You can increase the `max_slot_wal_keep_size` parameter for your Supabase database to a higher value (at least 100GB or `102400`) by following the [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/custom-postgres-config#cli-supported-parameters)

For better recommendation of this value you can contact the PeerDB team.

<Note>
When creating the Mirror, make sure to reuse the same publication you created earlier in Step 1
