This is a guide on how to create a Supabase PostgreSQL peer which you can use for replication in PeerDB.
<Note>
PeerDB Cloud supports Supabase via IPv6 natively for seemless replication.

<Steps titleSize='h2'>
<Step title='Creating a user with permissions and replication slot'>

Let's create a new user for PeerDB with the necessary permissions suitable for CDC,
and also create a publication that we'll use for replication. For this, you can head over to the **SQL Editor** for your Supabase Project.

1. Create a dedicated user for PeerDB:

    1. ```sql
            CREATE USER peerdb_user PASSWORD 'some-password';
       ```

2. Grant schema-level, read-only access to the user you created in the previous step. The following example shows permissions for the `public` schema. Repeat these commands for each schema containing tables you want to replicate:

    1. ```sql
            GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA "public" TO peerdb_user;
            GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA "public" TO peerdb_user;
            ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA "public" GRANT SELECT ON TABLES TO peerdb_user;
       ```

3. Grant replication privileges to the user:

    1. ```sql
            ALTER USER peerdb_user WITH REPLICATION;
       ```

4. Create a [publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-publication.html) with the tables you want to replicate. We strongly recommend only including the tables you need in the publication to avoid performance overhead.

    <PubNote />

    1. To create a publication for specific tables:

      ```sql
            CREATE PUBLICATION peerdb_publication FOR TABLE table_to_replicate, table_to_replicate2;
      ```

   2. To create a publication for all tables in a specific schema:

      ```sql
            CREATE PUBLICATION peerdb_publication FOR TABLES IN SCHEMA "public";
      ```

   The `peerdb_publication` publication will contain the set of change events generated from the specified tables, and will later be used to create the MIRROR (replication).

Click on **Run** to have a publication and a user ready.

<Note>
Make sure to replace `peerdb_user` and `peerdb_password` with your desired username and password.

Also, remember to use the same publication name when creating the mirror in PeerDB.

<Step title='Create the Supabase Peer on PeerDB OSS'>

1. Head over to your Supabase Project's `Project Settings` -> `Database` (under `Configuration`).

**Important**: Disable `Display connection pooler` on this page and head over to the `Connection parameters` section and note/copy the parameters.

2. Head over to PeerDB UI and click on **Create Peer**. Select **Postgres** as the source.

3. Now you can fill in the connection details you copied earlier, but make sure to use the username and password you created earlier in the SQL Editor in Step 1.

4. Click on **Validate** and once that's green, you can go ahead and click on **Create** to create the peer!


</Step>
<Step title='Increase max_slot_wal_keep_size'>
This is a recommended configuration change to ensure that large transactions/commits do not cause the replication slot to be dropped.

<Warning>
This step will restart your Supabase database and may cause a brief downtime.
</Warning>

You can increase the `max_slot_wal_keep_size` parameter for your Supabase database to a higher value (at least 100GB or `102400`) by following the [Supabase Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/custom-postgres-config#cli-supported-parameters)

For better recommendation of this value you can contact the PeerDB team.

<Note>
When creating the Mirror, make sure to reuse the same publication you created earlier in Step 1
