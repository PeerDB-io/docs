description: "Guide to pausing Mirrors in PeerDB"

`PAUSE MIRROR` temporarily stops a mirror from syncing. Use this to perform maintenance, inspections, or configuration changes without deleting the mirror.

1. As of today, mirrors can only be paused during CDC and not during initial load or query replication.
2. The PostgreSQL source replication slot will still exist and it will continue to grow as long the mirror is paused.
3. Pausing a mirror enables you to then add tables to the CDC mirror, along with editing the Sync Interval and Pull Batch Size.

<Info>
At the moment, there is no syntax available to add tables or edit the sync interval and pull batch size using SQL commands; you need to use [the UI](/features/edit-mirror) or [API](/peerdb-api/endpoints/change-mirror-state) to perform these actions.
</Info>

## Syntax

```sql
PAUSE MIRROR [IF EXISTS] <mirror_name>;
```

## Behavior

- When `IF EXISTS` is provided, the command is a no-op if the mirror is missing.
- If the mirror is currently active, the command will stop future sync runs and attempt to gracefully pause any in-flight work.
- If the mirror is already paused, the command is a no-op.

## Considerations

1. Pausing preserves the mirror configuration and state so it can be resumed later with [Resume Mirror](/sql/commands/resume-mirror).
