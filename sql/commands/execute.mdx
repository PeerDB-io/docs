title: Executing Raw Queries
description: "Guide to executing raw queries against a Peer using EXECUTE"
---

Use the EXECUTE command to send a raw SQL query directly to a configured Peer. This bypasses PeerDB's query-rewriting layer and sends the provided query text to the remote database behind the named peer.

## Syntax

```sql
EXECUTE <peer_name>(<query_text>);
```

Notes:

- `<peer_name>` must be the name of an [existing peer](/sql/commands/create-peer).
- `<query_text>` is a string literal containing the SQL to run on the remote peer. The string must be quoted using single quotes.

## Examples

Run a simple select on a Postgres peer:

```sql
EXECUTE postgres_peer('SELECT id, name FROM public.users WHERE id < 10;');
```

Run a statement that creates a temporary table on the remote peer:

```sql
EXECUTE postgres_peer('CREATE TEMP TABLE tmp_select AS SELECT id FROM public.users LIMIT 100;');
```

## Behavior

- The query text is forwarded verbatim to the remote database connection associated with the peer.
- Results are returned to the caller exactly as the remote database would return them.

## Considerations

1. The remote query runs with the credentials configured for the peer. Ensure the peer's credentials have the minimal privileges required.
2. Since the query runs directly on the remote system, it can modify data or schema. Be cautious when running DDL or DML via `EXECUTE` in production environments.
3. The query must use the dialect and capabilities of the remote database type.
