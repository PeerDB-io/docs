PeerDB allows you to resync a Change-Data Capture (CDC) mirror. Resync is currently supported for the following target connectors:

1. Clickhouse
2. PostgreSQL
3. Snowflake
4. BigQuery

## Syntax

```sql
RESYNC MIRROR [IF EXISTS] <mirror_name>;
```

## Behavior

- When `IF EXISTS` is provided, the command is a no-op if the mirror is missing.
- For more details on mirror resync, refer to the [documentation](/features/resync-mirror).
