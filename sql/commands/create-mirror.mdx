PeerDB introduces CREATE MIRROR command for blazing fast syncs between Peers. This section captures different types of MIRRORs and how to kick them off.

## Command Reference

### MIRROR for CDC

This type of MIRROR streams change feed in real-time from source peer to target peer.

```sql
CREATE MIRROR <mirror_name>
FROM <source_peer> TO <target_peer>
WITH TABLE MAPPING 
(<schema_name>.<source_table_name>:<schema_name>.<target_table_name>, 
<schema_name>.<source_table_name>:<schema_name>.<target_table_name>);
```

### MIRROR for Streaming Query Results

This type of MIRROR periodically streams query results on the source peer to the target peer.


```sql
CREATE MIRROR <mirror_name> FROM
	<source_peer> TO <target_peer> FOR
$$
  SELECT * FROM <source_table_name> WHERE
  <watermark_column> >= {{.start}} AND updated_at < {{.end}}
$$
WITH (
	destination_table_name = '<schema_qualified_destination_table_name>',
	watermark_column = '<watermark_column>',
	watermark_table_name = '<table_on_source_on_which_watermark_filter_should_be_applied>',
	mode = '<mode>',
	unique_key_columns = '<unique_key_columns>',
	parallelism = <parallelism>,
	refresh_interval = <refresh_interval_in_seconds>,
	batch_duration_timestamp = <partition_size_in_seconds>,
	sync_data_format = '<sync_data_format>'
);
```
The OPTIONS clause provides granular control when configuring the MIRROR:
    1. **watermark_column (Required)** represents a sequentially incrementing integer or timestamp column. PeerDB uses this column to keep track of the processed rows and the ones that need to be processed.
    2. **watermark_table (Required)** is the table that PeerDB iterates sequentially based on the watermark_column. The fact table is a good candidate for the watermark_table.
    3. **mode (Required)** tells PeerDB whether it should append data to the target or perform an upsert operation (update if the row exists).
        1. If your data is append-only, a sequential ID or a created_at column can be a good watermark, and you can choose the mode **append_only.**
        2. If your data is updated, make sure to have an "updated_at" column for PeerDB to identify the most recent version of the row. Choose the mode **upsert** to update already existing rows on the target.
            1. **unique_key:** In the upsert mode, you need to specify a set of columns (unique_key) that uniquely identify a row. This helps perform the upsert operation.
    4. **parallelism (Optional)** represents the number of threads used to read from the source and sync to the target. This helps with workload management on the source and target.
        1. If you have a powerful PostgreSQL server or if it is a read-replica, you can configure a higher parallelism value. In scenarios where you want to put less load on the source, you can choose a lower value.
    5. **refresh_interval (Optional)** helps configure the frequency (in minutes) at which the sync should run. If not specified, PeerDB syncs the data continuously without pauses.
    6. More details on the OPTIONs can be found [here](https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb/issues/139).
