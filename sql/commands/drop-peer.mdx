Use `DROP PEER` to remove a peer configuration from PeerDB.

## Syntax

```sql
DROP PEER [IF EXISTS] <peer_name>;
```

## Behavior

- When `IF EXISTS` is provided, the command is a no-op if the peer is missing.
- Dropping a peer removes its connection metadata from PeerDB and prevents any future queries or mirrors from using it.

## Considerations

1. All mirrors referencing this peer should be [deleted first](/sql/commands/drop-mirror); dropping a peer with active mirrors will have no effect.
2. Dropping a peer does not remove any data that was previously synced to target peers.
3. For safety in production, prefer `IF EXISTS` and ensure mirrors are removed or migrated beforehand.
