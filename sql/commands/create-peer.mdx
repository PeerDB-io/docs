title: Creating Peers
description: "Guide to creating Peers in PeerDB"
---

PeerDB currently supports 3 types of Peers. To connect a database to PeerDB, you need to create a Peer. A Peer is a connection to a database that PeerDB can query. Peers are created using the `CREATE PEER` command.

1. [BigQuery](#bigquery-peer)
2. [Snowflake](#snowflake-peer)
3. [PostgreSQL](#postgresql-peer)
4. [Amazon S3](#s3-peer)
5. [SQL Server](#sqlserver-peer)
6. [Azure EventHubs](#eventhub-peer)

## BigQuery Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER bq_peer FROM BIGQUERY WITH
(
  type = 'service_account',
  project_id = '<project_id>',
  private_key_id = '<private_key_id>',
  private_key = '<private_key>',
  client_email = '<client_email>',
  client_id = '<client_id>',
  auth_uri = '<auth_uri>',
  token_uri = '<token_uri>',
  auth_provider_x509_cert_url = '<auth_provider_x509_cert_url>',
  client_x509_cert_url = '<client_x509_cert_url>',
  dataset_id = '<dataset_id>'
);

-- Query away tables in BigQuery
SELECT * FROM bq_peer.test_table;
```

### Authentication

PeerDB authenticates the creation of a BigQuery peer based on the service account. All the fields within the `CREATE PEER` command can be acquired from a service account JSON.
If you have a service account key, you can use that or [create a new one](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) dedicated for PeerDB.

<Info>Make sure you have the right permissions for the service account, PeerDB requires at least read permissions for querying. For MIRROR it requires both read and write.</Info>

### Known Limitations

1. **Dataset Specific:** PeerDB only supports querying tables within a dataset. Cross dataset joins are not supported yet.
2. **Read Only:** You can only read from a BQ peer. Writing to the BQ peer is not yet supported.
3. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying. Record and Struct data-types are projected as JSONB. JSON datatype in BQ is not supported yet.
4. **SQL Coverage:** Most SQL constructs in reads incl. Simple Selects, JOINs, aggregations, window functions, CTEs etc are supported. You can run both Postgres compatible and BQ compatible queries through PeerDBs interface.
5. **Error Handling:** If a query fails on the BigQuery side because of lack of auth or query coverage or timeout, PeerDB handles that error and propagates the entire message  as a JSON text to the end-user. We also capture this ERROR message within PeerDB logs.


## Snowflake Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER sf_peer FROM SNOWFLAKE WITH
(
  account_id = 'LC83243.us-east-2.aws',
  username = 'saipeerdb',
  private_key ='<private_key>',
  database = '<db name>',
  schema = '<schema>',
  warehouse = '<WARE_HOUSE>',
  role = '<role>',
  query_timeout = '<query_timeout_in_seconds'
);

-- Query away tables in Snowflake
SELECT * FROM sf_peer.<schema>.<tablename>;
```



### Authentication

PeerDB authenticates the creation of a Snowflake peer based key pair authentication. 
Refer to this [doc](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-authentication) to create key pair, assign them to the right role and help populate the above fields.

<Info>Make sure you have the right permissions for the service account, PeerDB requires at least read permissions for querying. For MIRROR it requires both read and write.</Info>


### Known Limitations

1. **Database Specific:** PeerDB only supports querying tables within a dataset. Cross dataset joins are not supported yet.
2. **Read Only:** You can only read from a Snowflake peer. Writing to the Snowflake peer is not yet supported.
3. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying.
4. **SQL Coverage:** Most SQL constructs in reads incl. Simple Selects, JOINs, aggregations, window functions, CTEs etc are supported. You can run both Postgres compatible and SF compatible queries through PeerDBs interface.
5. **Error Handling:** If a query fails on the Snowflake side because of lack of auth or query coverage or timeout, PeerDB handles that error and propagates the entire message  as a JSON text to the end-user. We also capture this ERROR message within PeerDB logs.


## PostgreSQL Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER postgres_peer FROM POSTGRES WITH
(
    host = '<hostname>', 
    port = '<port>',
    user = '<user>',
    password = '<password>',
    database = '<dbname>'
);

-- Query away tables in Postgres
SELECT * FROM postgres_peer.<schema>.<tablename>;
```
If you are connecting to a Docker Postgres instance on the same docker network as PeerDB, then the hostname will be the service name of the Postgres server and the port will be the right-hand side port.

### Known Limitations

1. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying. We are actively addding support for other types.
2. **Unsupported COPY command:** COPY command is not supported yet.

## S3 Peer

The prefix is of your choice.
```sql
CREATE PEER s3_peer FROM S3 WITH
(
    url = 's3://<bucket>/<prefix>'
);
```
In order to use this peer for realtime streaming, your AWS credentials must be filled in our PeerDB docker-compose file.

### Known Limitations

1. No query support: this peer is currently supported for realtime query replication only.
2. The bucket specified in the URL must already exist.
3. Only `.avro` file format is currently supported.

## SQLServer Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER sqlserver_peer FROM SQLSERVER WITH(
  server='<your-hostname>',
  port='<your-port>',
  user='<user>',
  password='<password>',
  database='<database>'
);
```
If you are connecting to a Docker SQL Server/Azure SQL Edge instance on the same docker network as PeerDB, then the hostname will be the service name of the SQL server and the port will be the right-hand side port.

### Known Limitations

1. No query support: This peer is currently supported for realtime query replication from SQL Server to PostgreSQL only.

## Eventhub Peer

This peer uses an external PostgreSQL instance to manage metadata for the mirror.

```sql
CREATE PEER eventhub_peer FROM EVENTHUB WITH(
  namespace='<your-namespace>',
  resource_group='<your-resource-group>',
  location='<location>', // eg: eastus
  metadata_db='host=<pghost> port=<pgport> user=<pguser> password=<pgpassword> database=<pgdatabase>' // PostgreSQL connection string
);
```
`metadata_db` must have a value of the form specified above with the 5 parameters - host, port, user, password and database specified. They can be in any order.

In order to use this peer, your **Eventhub credentials must be filled** in our PeerDB docker-compose file in the environments section of the `flow-worker` service:
```yaml
    environment:
      ENABLE_PROFILING: true
      PROFILING_SERVER: 0.0.0.0:6060
      TEMPORAL_HOST_PORT: temporalite:7233
      AZURE_CLIENT_ID: <client-id>
      AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: <secret>
      AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: <subscription-id>
      AZURE_TENANT_ID: <tenant-id>
```

### Known Limitations

1. No query support: This peer is currently supported for realtime CDC from PostgreSQL to Eventhub only.
