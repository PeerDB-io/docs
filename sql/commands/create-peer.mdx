description: "Guide to creating Peers in PeerDB"
---

PeerDB currently supports 3 types of Peers. To connect a database to PeerDB, you need to create a Peer. A Peer is a connection to a database that PeerDB can query. Peers are created using the `CREATE PEER` command.

1. [BigQuery](#bigquery-peer)
2. [Snowflake](#snowflake-peer)
3. [PostgreSQL](#postgresql-peer)

## BigQuery Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER bq_peer FROM BIGQUERY WITH
(
  type = 'service_account',
  project_id = '<project_id>',
  private_key_id = '<private_key_id>',
  private_key = '<private_key>',
  client_email = '<client_email>',
  client_id = '<client_id>',
  auth_uri = '<auth_uri>',
  token_uri = '<token_uri>',
  auth_provider_x509_cert_url = '<auth_provider_x509_cert_url>',
  client_x509_cert_url = '<client_x509_cert_url>',
  dataset_id = '<dataset_id>'
);

-- Query away tables in BigQuery
SELECT * FROM bq_peer.test_table;
```

### Authentication

PeerDB authenticates the creation of a BigQuery peer based on the service account. All the fields within the `CREATE PEER` command can be acquired from a service account JSON.
If you have a service account key, you can use that or [create a new one](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) dedicated for PeerDB.

<Info>Make sure you have the right permissions for the service account, PeerDB requires at least read permissions for querying. For MIRROR it requires both read and write.</Info>

### Known Limitations

1. **Dataset Specific:** PeerDB only supports querying tables within a dataset. Cross dataset joins are not supported yet.
2. **Read Only:** You can only read from a BQ peer. Writing to the BQ peer is not yet supported.
3. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying. Record and Struct data-types are projected as JSONB. JSON datatype in BQ is not supported yet.
4. **SQL Coverage:** Most SQL constructs in reads incl. Simple Selects, JOINs, aggregations, window functions, CTEs etc are supported. You can run both Postgres compatible and BQ compatible queries through PeerDBs interface.
5. **Error Handling:** If a query fails on the BigQuery side because of lack of auth or query coverage or timeout, PeerDB handles that error and propagates the entire message  as a JSON text to the end-user. We also capture this ERROR message within PeerDB logs.


## Snowflake Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER sf_peer FROM SNOWFLAKE WITH
(
  account_id = 'LC83243.us-east-2.aws',
  username = 'saipeerdb',
  private_key ='<private_key>',
  database = '<db name>',
  schema = '<schema>',
  warehouse = '<WARE_HOUSE>',
  role = '<role>',
  query_timeout = '<query_timeout_in_seconds'
);

-- Query away tables in Snowflake
SELECT * FROM sf_peer.<schema>.<tablename>;
```



### Authentication

PeerDB authenticates the creation of a Snowflake peer based key pair authentication. 
Refer to this [doc](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-authentication) to create key pair, assign them to the right role and help populate the above fields.

<Info>Make sure you have the right permissions for the service account, PeerDB requires at least read permissions for querying. For MIRROR it requires both read and write.</Info>


### Known Limitations

1. **Database Specific:** PeerDB only supports querying tables within a dataset. Cross dataset joins are not supported yet.
2. **Read Only:** You can only read from a Snowflake peer. Writing to the Snowflake peer is not yet supported.
3. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying.
4. **SQL Coverage:** Most SQL constructs in reads incl. Simple Selects, JOINs, aggregations, window functions, CTEs etc are supported. You can run both Postgres compatible and SF compatible queries through PeerDBs interface.
5. **Error Handling:** If a query fails on the Snowflake side because of lack of auth or query coverage or timeout, PeerDB handles that error and propagates the entire message  as a JSON text to the end-user. We also capture this ERROR message within PeerDB logs.


## PostgreSQL Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER postgres_peer FROM POSTGRES WITH
(
    host = '<hostname>',
    port = '<port>',
    user = '<user>',
    password = '<password>',
    database = '<dbname>'
);

-- Query away tables in Postgres
SELECT * FROM postgres_peer.<schema>.<tablename>;
```

### Known Limitations

1. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying. We are actively addding support for other types.
2. **Unsupported COPY command:** COPY command is not supported yet.
