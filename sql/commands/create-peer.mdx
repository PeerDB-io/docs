title: Creating Peers
description: "Guide to creating Peers in PeerDB"
---

PeerDB currently supports the below types of Peers. To connect a database to PeerDB, you need to create a Peer. A Peer is a connection to a database that PeerDB can query. Peers are created using the `CREATE PEER` command.

1. [BigQuery](#bigquery-peer)
2. [Snowflake](#snowflake-peer)
3. [PostgreSQL](#postgresql-peer)
4. [Amazon S3](#s3-peer)
5. [SQL Server](#sqlserver-peer)
6. [Azure EventHubs](#eventhub-peer)

## BigQuery Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER bq_peer FROM BIGQUERY WITH
(
  type = 'service_account',
  project_id = '<project_id>',
  private_key_id = '<private_key_id>',
  private_key = '<private_key>',
  client_email = '<client_email>',
  client_id = '<client_id>',
  auth_uri = '<auth_uri>',
  token_uri = '<token_uri>',
  auth_provider_x509_cert_url = '<auth_provider_x509_cert_url>',
  client_x509_cert_url = '<client_x509_cert_url>',
  dataset_id = '<dataset_id>'
);

-- Query away tables in BigQuery
SELECT * FROM bq_peer.test_table;
```

### Authentication

PeerDB authenticates the creation of a BigQuery peer based on the service account. All the fields within the `CREATE PEER` command can be acquired from a service account JSON.
If you have a service account key, you can use that or [create a new one](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) dedicated for PeerDB.

<Info>
  Make sure you have the right permissions for the service account, PeerDB
  requires at least read permissions for querying. For MIRROR it requires both
  read and write.
</Info>

### Considerations

1. **Dataset Specific:** PeerDB only supports querying tables within a dataset. Cross dataset joins are not supported yet.
2. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying. Record and Struct data-types are projected as JSONB. JSON datatype in BQ is not supported yet.
3. **SQL Coverage:** Most SQL constructs in reads incl. Simple Selects, JOINs, aggregations, window functions, CTEs etc are supported. You can run both Postgres compatible and BQ compatible queries through PeerDBs interface.
4. **Error Handling:** If a query fails on the BigQuery side because of lack of auth or query coverage or timeout, PeerDB handles that error and propagates the entire message as a JSON text to the end-user. We also capture this ERROR message within PeerDB logs.

## Snowflake Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER sf_peer FROM SNOWFLAKE WITH
(
  account_id = 'LC83243.us-east-2.aws',
  username = 'saipeerdb',
  private_key ='<private_key>',
  database = '<db name>',
  schema = '<schema>',
  warehouse = '<WARE_HOUSE>',
  role = '<role>',
  query_timeout = '<query_timeout_in_seconds'
);

-- Query away tables in Snowflake
SELECT * FROM sf_peer.<schema>.<tablename>;
```

### Authentication

PeerDB authenticates the creation of a Snowflake peer based key pair authentication.
Refer to this [doc](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-authentication) to create key pair, assign them to the right role and help populate the above fields.

<Info>
  Make sure you have the right permissions for the service account, PeerDB
  requires at least read permissions for querying. For MIRROR it requires both
  read and write.
</Info>

### Considerations

1. **Database Specific:** PeerDB only supports querying tables within a dataset. Cross dataset joins are not supported yet.
2. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying.
3. **SQL Coverage:** Most SQL constructs in reads incl. Simple Selects, JOINs, aggregations, window functions, CTEs etc are supported. You can run both Postgres compatible and SF compatible queries through PeerDBs interface.
4. **Error Handling:** If a query fails on the Snowflake side because of lack of auth or query coverage or timeout, PeerDB handles that error and propagates the entire message as a JSON text to the end-user. We also capture this ERROR message within PeerDB logs.

## PostgreSQL Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER postgres_peer FROM POSTGRES WITH
(
    host = '<hostname>',
    port = '<port>',
    user = '<user>',
    password = '<password>',
    database = '<dbname>'
);

-- Query away tables in Postgres
SELECT * FROM postgres_peer.<schema>.<tablename>;
```

If you are connecting to a Docker Postgres instance on the same docker network as PeerDB, then the hostname will be the service name of the Postgres server and the port will be `5432`.

### Considerations

1. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying. We are actively addding support for other types.
2. **Unsupported COPY command:** COPY command is not supported yet.


## Storage Peers - S3 and GCS
For CDC, you would require a PostgreSQL instance to use as an external metadata store.
The CREATE PEER command for S3/GCS depends on how you set the following parameters.
```sql
CREATE PEER storage_peer FROM S3 WITH
(
    url = 's3://<gcs/s3_bucket_name>/<prefix>', -- bucket should exist
    access_key_id = '<hmac_key>', -- or AWS equivalent
    secret_access_key = '<hmac_secret>', -- or AWS equivalent
    region = 'auto', -- for S3, use the region of your bucket
    endpoint = 'https://storage.googleapis.com', -- or empty for S3
    metadata_db = 'host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<database>'
);
```
 Note that if you leave any of these parameters empty, PeerDB will use the corresponding Docker compose environment variable instead:
```yaml
x-flow-worker-env: &flow-worker-env
  ...
  # For GCS, these will be your HMAC keys instead
  # For more information:
  # https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/managing-hmackeys
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:-}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:-}
  # For GCS, set this to "auto" without the quotes
  AWS_REGION: ${AWS_REGION:-}
  # For GCS, set this as: https://storage.googleapis.com
  AWS_ENDPOINT: ${AWS_ENDPOINT:-}
  ...
```

### Considerations

1. The bucket specified in the URL must already exist.
2. Only `.avro` file format is currently supported.
3. Currently only data-movement is supported for this type of peer. Querying this peer from PeerDB's interface is not supported.

## SQLServer Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER sqlserver_peer FROM SQLSERVER WITH(
  server='<your-hostname>',
  port='<your-port>',
  user='<user>',
  password='<password>',
  database='<database>'
);
```

If you are connecting to a Docker SQL Server/Azure SQL Edge instance on the same docker network as PeerDB, then the hostname will be the service name of the SQL server and the port will be `5432`.

### Considerations

1. Currently only data-movement is supported for this type of peer. Querying this peer from PeerDB's interface is not supported.

## Eventhub Support

### EventHub Peer

This peer uses an external PostgreSQL instance to manage metadata for the mirror. To create an EVENTHUB peer, use the following SQL syntax:

```sql
CREATE PEER <eh_peer_name> FROM EVENTHUB WITH (
  subscription_id = '<subscription-id>',
  resource_group = '<resource-group-name>',
  namespace = '<namespace-name>',
  location = '<location>',  -- eg: eastus
  partition_count = '<number-of-partitions>',
  message_retention_in_days = '<retention-days>'
);
```

**Parameters:**

- `subscription_id`: The ID of the Azure subscription.
- `resource_group`: The name of the Azure resource group.
- `namespace`: The namespace for the EVENTHUB.
- `location`: The location of the EVENTHUB instance, e.g., eastus.
- `partition_count`: The number of partitions for the EVENTHUB.
- `message_retention_in_days`: The number of days the messages will be retained.

### EventHubGroup Peer

You will need to wrap multiple EVENTHUB peers in an EVENTHUBGROUP peer to create a mirror. To create an EVENTHUBGROUP peer, use the following SQL syntax:

```sql
CREATE PEER <eh_group_name> FROM EVENTHUBGROUP WITH (
  mq_test_peer_7 = true, -- enable this member
  metadata_db = 'host=<hostname> user=<username> port=<port-number> password=<password> database=<database-name>',
  unnest_columns = '<column-names>'
);
```

**Parameters:**

- `mq_test_peer_7`: Enable this EVENTHUB member in the group. You can enable multiple EVENTHUB peers in the group.
- `metadata_db`: The PostgreSQL connection string for the metadata database. Ensure it includes host, user, port, password, and database details.
- `unnest_columns`: Specifies the columns you'd like to unnest in the EVENTHUBGROUP.

In order to use this peer, your **Azure credentials must be filled** in our PeerDB docker-compose file in the environments section of the `flow-worker` service:

```yaml
environment:
  ENABLE_PROFILING: true
  PROFILING_SERVER: 0.0.0.0:6060
  TEMPORAL_HOST_PORT: temporalite:7233
  AZURE_CLIENT_ID: <client-id>
  AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: <secret>
  AZURE_TENANT_ID: <tenant-id>
```

### Considerations

1. Currently only data-movement is supported for this type of peer. Querying this peer from PeerDB's interface is not supported.
