title: Creating Peers
description: "Guide to creating Peers in PeerDB"
---

PeerDB currently supports the below types of Peers. To connect a database to PeerDB, you need to create a Peer. A Peer is a connection to a database that PeerDB can query. Peers are created using the `CREATE PEER` command.

1. [BigQuery](#bigquery-peer)
2. [Snowflake](#snowflake-peer)
3. [PostgreSQL](#postgresql-peer)
4. [SQL Server](#sqlserver-peer)
5. [MySQL](#mysql-peer)
6. [Storage Peers - S3 and Google Cloud](#storage-peers-s3-and-gcs)
7. [Azure EventHubs](#eventhub-peer)

## BigQuery Peer

### Create Peer using UI
Using the PeerDB UI (localhost:3000), create the Snowflake Peer. See below video as reference:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/4919db8f165a40e583dcde18b0ffe6a1?sid=ae95b635-5726-42a9-b60d-801d7777a8e2"
    frameBorder={0}
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%"
    }}
  />
</div>

### Create Peer using connection string

```sql
CREATE PEER bq_peer FROM BIGQUERY WITH
(
  type = 'service_account',
  project_id = '<project_id>',
  private_key_id = '<private_key_id>',
  private_key = '<private_key>',
  client_email = '<client_email>',
  client_id = '<client_id>',
  auth_uri = '<auth_uri>',
  token_uri = '<token_uri>',
  auth_provider_x509_cert_url = '<auth_provider_x509_cert_url>',
  client_x509_cert_url = '<client_x509_cert_url>',
  dataset_id = '<dataset_id>'
);

-- Query away tables in BigQuery
SELECT * FROM bq_peer.test_table;
```

### Authentication

PeerDB authenticates the creation of a BigQuery peer based on the service account. All the fields within the `CREATE PEER` command can be acquired from a service account JSON.
If you have a service account key, you can use that or [create a new one](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete) dedicated for PeerDB.

<Info>
  Make sure you have the right permissions for the service account, PeerDB
  requires at least read permissions for querying. For MIRROR it requires both
  read and write.
</Info>

### Considerations

1. **Dataset Specific:** PeerDB only supports querying tables within a dataset. Cross dataset joins are not supported yet.
2. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying. Record and Struct data-types are projected as JSONB. JSON datatype in BQ is not supported yet.
3. **SQL Coverage:** Most SQL constructs in reads incl. Simple Selects, JOINs, aggregations, window functions, CTEs etc are supported. You can run both Postgres compatible and BQ compatible queries through PeerDBs interface.
4. **Error Handling:** If a query fails on the BigQuery side because of lack of auth or query coverage or timeout, PeerDB handles that error and propagates the entire message as a JSON text to the end-user. We also capture this ERROR message within PeerDB logs.

## Snowflake Peer

### Create Peer using UI
Using the PeerDB UI (localhost:3000), create the Snowflake Peer. See below video as reference:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/7a8eb794911e49e9bc994c03d0cfeda0?sid=041aa7ea-5ed3-43f5-b4e3-51c39aa2f133"
    frameBorder={0}
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%"
    }}
  />
</div>

### Create Peer using connection string

```sql
CREATE PEER sf_peer FROM SNOWFLAKE WITH
(
  account_id = '<snowflake_account_identifier>',
  username = '<user_name>',
  private_key ='<private_key>',
  password = '<password>' -- only provide when the private key is encrypted
  database = '<database_name>',
  schema = '<schema>',
  warehouse = '<ware_house>',
  role = '<role>',
  query_timeout = '<query_timeout_in_seconds>'
);

-- Query away tables in Snowflake
SELECT * FROM sf_peer.<schema>.<tablename>;
```
### Granting permissions
PeerDB needs to be able to create, read and write to objects in the database you provide. The following commands ensure a smooth mirror:
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE <dbname> TO ROLE <role_used_while_creating_peer>;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <schema> TO <role_used_while_creating_peer>;
GRANT ALL ON SCHEMA <schema> TO <role_used_while_creating_peer>;
```
More information can be found [here](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-access-control-configure#label-security-custom-role).
### Authentication

PeerDB authenticates the creation of a Snowflake peer based key pair authentication. Encrypted private keys are also supported.
Refer to this [doc](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth#configuring-key-pair-authentication) to create key pair, assign them to the right role and help populate the above fields.

### Considerations

1. **Database Specific:** PeerDB only supports querying tables within a database. Cross database joins are not supported yet.
2. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying.
3. **SQL Coverage:** Most SQL constructs in reads incl. Simple Selects, JOINs, aggregations, window functions, CTEs etc are supported. You can run both Postgres compatible and SF compatible queries through PeerDBs interface.
4. **Error Handling:** If a query fails on the Snowflake side because of lack of auth or query coverage or timeout, PeerDB handles that error and propagates the entire message as a JSON text to the end-user. We also capture this ERROR message within PeerDB logs.

## PostgreSQL Peer
### Create Peer using UI
Using the PeerDB UI (localhost:3000), create the Postgres Peer. See below video as reference:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/a28dcf4f54a24102a7522bf3834a204e?sid=fde66e4a-778e-4f15-a284-0dd0f1116541"
    frameBorder={0}
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%"
    }}
  />
</div>

### Create Peer using connection string
```sql
CREATE PEER postgres_peer FROM POSTGRES WITH
(
    host = '<hostname>',
    port = '<port>',
    user = '<user>',
    password = '<password>',
    database = '<dbname>'
);

-- Query away tables in Postgres
SELECT * FROM postgres_peer.<schema>.<tablename>;
```

If you are connecting to a Docker Postgres instance on the same docker network as PeerDB, then the hostname will be the service name of the Postgres server and the port will be `5432`.

### Considerations

1. **Supported Datatypes:** All string, numeric and timestamp based datatypes are supported for querying. We are actively addding support for other types.
2. **Unsupported COPY command:** COPY command is not supported yet.


## Storage Peers - S3 and GCS

### Create Peer using UI
Using the PeerDB UI (localhost:3000), create the Snowflake Peer. See below video as reference:

<div style={{ position: "relative", paddingBottom: "56.25%", height: 0 }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.loom.com/embed/321a0d0becc249c9ab3478e1ea0bad33?sid=737eebc9-e019-4772-9b6b-4cf47d428a95"
    frameBorder={0}
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%"
    }}
  />
</div>

### Create Peer using connection string

For CDC, you would require a PostgreSQL instance to use as an external metadata store.
The CREATE PEER command for S3/GCS depends on how you set the following parameters.
```sql
CREATE PEER storage_peer FROM S3 WITH
(
    url = 's3://<gcs/s3_bucket_name>/<prefix>', -- bucket should exist
    access_key_id = '<hmac_key>', -- or AWS equivalent
    secret_access_key = '<hmac_secret>', -- or AWS equivalent
    region = 'auto', -- for S3, use the region of your bucket
    endpoint = 'https://storage.googleapis.com', -- or empty for S3
    metadata_db = 'host=<host> port=<port> user=<user> password=<password> database=<database>'
);
```
 Note that if you leave any of these parameters empty, PeerDB will use the corresponding Docker compose environment variable instead:
```yaml
x-flow-worker-env: &flow-worker-env
  ...
  # For GCS, these will be your HMAC keys instead
  # For more information:
  # https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/managing-hmackeys
  AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID:-}
  AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY:-}
  # For GCS, set this to "auto" without the quotes
  AWS_REGION: ${AWS_REGION:-}
  # For GCS, set this as: https://storage.googleapis.com
  AWS_ENDPOINT: ${AWS_ENDPOINT:-}
  ...
```

### Considerations

1. The bucket specified in the URL must already exist.
2. Only `.avro` file format is currently supported.
3. Currently only data-movement is supported for this type of peer. Querying this peer from PeerDB's interface is not supported.

## SQLServer Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER sqlserver_peer FROM SQLSERVER WITH (
  server='<your-hostname>',
  port='<your-port>',
  user='<user>',
  password='<password>',
  database='<database>'
);
```

If you are connecting to a Docker SQL Server/Azure SQL Edge instance on the same docker network as PeerDB, then the hostname will be the service name of the SQL server and the port will be `5432`.

### Considerations

1. Currently only data-movement is supported for this type of peer. Querying this peer from PeerDB's interface is not supported.

## MySQL Peer

```sql
CREATE PEER mysql_peer FROM MYSQL WITH (
  host='<your-hostname>',
  port=3006,
  user='<user>'
  password='<password>',
  database='<database>',
  setup='set session transaction level read only',
  disable_tls=false
);
```

### Considerations

1. Currently only querying is supported for this type of peer. Mirrors are not supported.
2. `setup` is optional, but can be used to run queries when connection setup. Useful for setting transactions as read only by default, or setting catalog/database with `use catalog.database` for [StarRocks](https://www.starrocks.io)

## EventHub Peer

To create an Eventhub peer, use the following SQL syntax:

```sql
CREATE PEER eventhubs_peer_x FROM EVENTHUBS WITH (
eventhubs = '[{"subscription_id":"my-sub-id",
"resource_group":"myresource",
"namespace":"mynamespace-1",
"location":"eastus",
"partition_count":5,
"message_retention_in_days":2
},
{"subscription_id":"my-sub-id",
"resource_group":"myresource",
"namespace":"mynamespace-2",
"location":"eastus",
"partition_count":3,
"message_retention_in_days":1
}
]',
unnest_columns = [] -- can omit this field too
);
```

**Parameters:**
- `eventhubs`: A JSON array of details of namespaces. Each item should have the following fields:
  - `subscription_id`: The ID of the Azure subscription.
  - `resource_group`: The name of the Azure resource group.
  - `namespace`: The namespace for the Eventhub.
  - `location`: The location of the Eventhub namespace's resource group, e.g., eastus.
  - `partition_count`: The number of partitions for the Eventhub.
  - `message_retention_in_days`: The number of days the messages will be retained.
- `unnest_columns`: Specifies the columns you'd like to unnest


In order to use this peer in a self-hosted PeerDB instance, your **Azure credentials must be filled** in our PeerDB docker-compose file in the environments section of the `flow-worker` service:

```yaml
environment:
  AZURE_CLIENT_ID: <client-id>
  AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET: <secret>
  AZURE_TENANT_ID: <tenant-id>
```

### Considerations

1. Currently only CDC data-movement is supported for this type of peer. Querying this peer from PeerDB's interface is not supported.
