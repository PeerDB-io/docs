Use `RESUME MIRROR` to restart a mirror that was previously [paused](/sql/commands/pause-mirror).

## Syntax

```sql
RESUME MIRROR [IF EXISTS] <mirror_name>;
```

## Behavior

- When `IF EXISTS` is provided, the command is a no-op if the mirror is missing.
- The mirror will be scheduled to continue syncing according to its configuration.
- If the mirror is already running, the command is a no-op.
