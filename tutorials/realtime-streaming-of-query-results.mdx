title: "Streaming Query Replication of PostgreSQL To Snowflake"
---

Below is a 5-minute tutorial to test [Streaming Query Replication from Postgres to Snowflake](/usecases/realtime-streaming-of-query-results)

### Step 1: CREATE Postgres and Snowflake Peers

    1. [CREATE Postgres PEER](/sql/commands/create-peer#postgresql-peer)
    2. [CREATE Snowflake PEER](/sql/commands/create-peer#snowflake-peer)

### Step 2: Create and populate tables on the Postgres PEER

    Below script helps creates and populate `pgbench_history` with dummy data on your PostgreSQL peer.
    ```sh
    curl -O https://peerdb-sample-data.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/import_data_for_tutorial.sh
    chmod +x import_data_for_tutorial.sh
    # "postgres://user:password@hostname:5432/dbname"
    # is the connection string of your PostgreSQL peer.
    ./import_data_for_tutorial.sh "postgres://user:password@hostname:5432/dbname"
    ```

### Step 3: Create pgbench_history table on the destination (snowflake) PEER

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE pgbench_history (tid integer, bid integer,
    aid integer, delta integer, mtime timestampntz, filler text);
    ```

### Step 4: Kick off MIRROR with 8 threads and 50000 rows per partition

    ```sql
    CREATE MIRROR postgres_to_snowflake_tutorial
    FROM postgres_peer TO snowflake_peer FOR
    $$SELECT * FROM public.pgbench_history WHERE mtime BETWEEN {{.start}} AND {{.end}}$$
    WITH (
    	watermark_column = 'mtime',
    	watermark_table_name = 'pgbench_history',
    	mode = 'append',
    	parallelism = 8,
    	refresh_interval = 10,
    	num_rows_per_partition = 50000,
    	sync_data_format = 'avro',
    	destination_table_name = 'public.pgbench_history'
    );
    ```

### Step 5: Monitor the MIRROR

You can connect to `localhost:8085` to gain full visibility into the different jobs and steps that PeerDB performs under the hood to manage the MIRROR.

### Step 6: Validate the MIRROR

In 1-2 minutes the MIRROR should complete syncing data. Now validate the data on both postgres and snowflake peers. Number of rows should match

```sql
SELECT count(*) FROM postgres_peer.pgbench_history;
SELECT count(*) FROM snowflake_peer.public.pgbench_history;
```
