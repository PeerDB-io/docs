## Real-time CDC from PostgreSQL

PeerDB introduces **CREATE MIRROR for streaming changes** to enable real-time Change Data Capture (CDC) from PostgreSQL to the Target peer. Currently we support **PostgreSQL (running anywhere)**, **Azure Event Hubs**, **BigQuery** and **Snowflake** as the target Peers.
1. You just need to run a few SQL commands, and PeerDB takes care of all the heavy lifting to set up and maintain a highly performant and resilient real-time synchronization between the databases.
> SQL commands make it super easy and intuitive to develop data pipelines in your test, dev, and prod environments.
>
2. In our initial benchmarks, we observed over 10x performance gains compared to other tools. The average lag for a workload that generates 1000 transactions per second on PostgreSQL was around 30 seconds.
