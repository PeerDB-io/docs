## Real-time CDC from PostgreSQL To Eventhub

Let's look at how we can seamlessly perform Change-Data Capturing (CDC) from PostgreSQL to topics in Azure EventHubs.

### Scenario

Suppose you have a banking application running on PostgreSQL. There are two tables: "users" and "transactions." You want to sync these tables in real-time to Eventhubs for your customers to consume from the topics. Let's see how we can make this happen within a few minutes and a few SQL commands using PeerDB.

### Prerequisites

1. Enable logical decoding in Postgres. Ensure that the following settings/GUCs are properly configured:
    1. wal_level: logical
    2. max_wal_senders: >1
    3. max_replication_slots: 4
2. Enable replication access for a PostgreSQL user - ALTER USER pg_user REPLICATION;
3. Ensure that both tables have primary keys. Composite primaries are also fine.
4. If you are using PostgreSQL on the cloud, below links capture how to enable logical replication for each cloud:
    1. [AWS RDS and Aurora PostgreSQL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.html#AuroraPostgreSQL.Replication.Logical.Configure)
    2. [Azure Database for PostgreSQL - Flexible Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/postgresql/flexible-server/concepts-logical#pre-requisites-for-logical-replication-and-logical-decoding)
    3. [GCP Cloud SQL PostgreSQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/replication/configure-logical-replication#configure-your-postgresql-instance)

### Step 1: Add Postgres and Eventhub Peers

Run the following commands to let PeerDB know about the existing Postgres and Eventhub Peers.

```sql
-- Connect to PeerDB
psql "port=9900 host=localhost password=peerdb"

-- Add Postgres and Eventhub peers
CREATE PEER postgres_peer FROM postgres (...);
CREATE PEER eventhub_peer FROM eventhub (...);
```

Make sure to replace **`(â€¦)`** with the appropriate connection details for both the PostgreSQL and Eventhub instances. More details on adding PEERs are available [here](https://docs.peerdb.io/sql/commands/create-peer).

### **Step 2: Real-Time CDC from PostgreSQL to Eventhub**

With the peers set up, you can create a mirror that facilitates real-time CDC from PostgreSQL to Eventhub. 

```sql
-- Real-time CDC from PostgreSQL to Eventhub
CREATE MIRROR real_time_cdc
FROM postgres_peer TO eventhub_peer
WITH TABLE MAPPING (public.transactions:public.transactions, public.users:public.users);
```

If you observe, **TABLE MAPPING** represents the table name mapping between Postgres and Eventhub. PeerDB automatically creates the topic with suitable data type mapping on the target. PeerDB supports 30+ native data types for Postgres in CREATE MIRROR. These data types are chosen in a way that there is no loss of data (e.g., precision) as part of the real-time sync.

### **Step 3: Validate the Mirror**

Validate the mirror by checking if the number of messages in the topics matches the row count on the source table.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM postgres_peer.public.transactions;
```

### Step 4: Monitor the MIRROR

You can connect to [`localhost:8233`](http://`localhost:8233`) to get full visibility into the different jobs and steps that PeerDB is taking under the covers to manage the MIRROR.

### Step 5: DROP MIRROR

To make it easy in your development and test environments, PeerDB also introduces the DROP MIRROR command. DROP MIRROR drops all the underlying objects that CREATE MIRROR generates. More details are available in this [PR](https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb/pull/93).

```sql
-- drop the mirror
DROP MIRROR real_time_cdc;
```
