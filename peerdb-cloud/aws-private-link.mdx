PeerDB Cloud supports AWS Private Link for secure and private connectivity between VPCs.
This allows you to connect your VPCs to PeerDB Cloud without exposing your data to the public internet.

## Setting up AWS Private Link with PeerDB Cloud

<Steps>
    <Step title="Setup Endpoint Service">
        1. Create the necessary endpoint service as per preference. Some of the common ways to achieve this are (for Postgres):
            - EC2 with script to fetch DNS records on schedule and update forwarding rules
            - Lambda with listener to Event Bridge (CloudFormation Template available in [AWS Docs](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/access-amazon-rds-across-vpcs-using-aws-privatelink-and-network-load-balancer/)
        2. Give access to the PeerDB's AWS ARN `arn:aws:iam::141675317444:root` (or Account ID `141675317444`) so that it can be discovered for establishing the Private Link connection
        3. (Optionally) Allow network connections from CIDR `10.0.0.0/16` to the Endpoint Service
        4. Provide PeerDB Team with Endpoint Service Name (`com.amazonawsâ€¦`) and the region where the service is located
           - This can be done either via contacting PeerDB Team via Slack or Email
    </Step>
    <Step title="PeerDB Team sets up Endpoint Interface">
        1. PeerDB Team will setup the necessary Endpoint Interface
        2. PeerDB Team will provide back the DNS name (for peer connectivity) and the Endpoint Interface ID for Accepting the Endpoint Interface request
    </Step>
    <Step title="Accept Endpoint Interface Request, Setup Peer">
        1. Accept the Endpoint Interface Request
        2. Create the peer via PeerDB UI (or ask PeerDB Team to perform a health check on the Endpoint Interface DNS from the same network as the PeerDB Cloud Instance)
    </Step>
</Steps>
