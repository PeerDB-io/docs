Security is paramount at PeerDB, and we take our commitment to protecting customer data very seriously. To provide a secure and compliant platform, we adhere to strict protocols and employ various measures to safeguard sensitive information.


## Compliance

PeerDB is currently compliant with the following frameworks:

* **SOC 2 Type II** - PeerDB is SOC 2 Type II Compliant and [our report](https://trust.peerdb.io/resources?s=t6nuewj8c7b5p948qzhth&name=soc-2-type-ii) is available on our [Trust Center](https://trust.peerdb.io)
* **GDPR** - Check out [our announcement/blog post here](https://blog.peerdb.io/peerdb-is-gdpr-compliant)
* **HIPAA** - For the Business Associate Agreement (BAA), please reach out to [privacy@peerdb.io](mailto:privacy@peerdb.io) and we will provide you with the same.


## Data Retention

PeerDB doesn’t store any customer specific data on their end: all the data that is transferred/staged, whether local or remote (S3) is **transient**.


## Access and Isolation


### Isolation

Every customer instance on PeerDB Cloud is **fully isolated** from other instances and all cross-instance traffic is explicitly denied by default.

More details are available in the [Isolation Architecture Doc](https://trust.peerdb.io/resources?s=s4vk91c8wyd5q0aok7x4sh&name=peer-db-cloud-customer-isolation-architecture) on our [Trust Center](https://trust.peerdb.io/).


### Access

PeerDB follows the Principle of Least Privilege wherever possible and requires **read-only access** to the source peers: no write access is needed.

Any and all internal traffic/access across instances is controlled via claim-based and role-based access-control, short-lived credentials and **security best-practices**.


## Encryption

Any data in transit is **fully encrypted**. Additionally customers can leverage SSH Tunneling to ensure that they don’t need to expose the public IP of the source peer/database.


### [SSH Tunneling for Secure Postgres Replication](https://blog.peerdb.io/ssh-tunneling-for-secure-postgres-replication)


We natively support SSH tunneling right from the first connection to your database. A very simple way to get started can be found [here](/connect/postgres/rds_postgres#peerdb-ssh-tunneling-guide-optional)
