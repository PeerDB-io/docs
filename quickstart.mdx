Deploying PeerDB is a simple process involving just a couple of steps.

1.  **Install Docker on your workstation:** Refer to [these instructions](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) if you haven't already done so. Make sure you have the latest version of `docker-compose`.

2.  **Run the following commands in your terminal:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PeerDB-io/peerdb.git
    cd peerdb
    docker-compose up
    ```

3.  **Connect to PeerDB:**


    ```bash
    psql "port=9900 host=localhost password=peerdb"
    ```


That's it! You now have PeerDB up and running on your machine, ready to query away!
